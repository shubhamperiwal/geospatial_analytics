# Geospatial Analytics

This course taught us how to analyse geospatial data in R and visualise them.

## Project Description

Our project would like to develop geographical accessibility and spatial interaction model to study the accessibility of HDB units to facilities in Singapore. The aspects of accessibility to look into includes:
  - the distance to healthcare facilities (General Practitioner Clinics, Polyclinics and Hospitals), 
  - transportation infrastructure (MRT stations and Bus Stops), 
  - Schools
  - Police Stations
  - and Hawker Centres 
for all HDBs in different regions, planning areas and planning subzones. 

We hope to develop an accessibility study tool through Analytic Hierarchy Process and enable urban planners leverage on this open-source, interactive, reproducible and highly accessible tool to better strategize urban planning policies.


## Project Details

We intend to:
- Study the spatial distribution of facilities and HDB units
- Identify the areas with poor accessibility to essential facilities
- Analyze and highlight regions with higher needs for certain facilities
- Indicate whether there is a substantial difference in accessibility to facilities across regions, planning areas and planning subzones
- Provide customizable input parameters on pairwise comparisons of facilities, thus allowing policy makers to generate overall Analytic Hierarchy Process accessibility score based on their prioritie
- Evaluate results of analysis and provide recommendations for urban planners to enhance the accessibility to different facilities
