Issues and Problem
Our team's objective is to analyse and determine how these facilities such as transportation, school and healthcare services would impact the accessibility level around HDB.

Motivation
The government has been finding sustainable ways to tackle the increasing inequality and stratification in Singapore.With constant development and improvement of infrastructure around 
Singapore, the impact on accessibility has not really been research upon.

Team approach
1) Data Preparation:
- Convert the address into langtitude and longtitude
- Transform all spatial reference   system to WGS 84

2) Set range of accessibilityTo avoid calculating distance between all facilities and houses, 
we drew a radius around each house and calculated distance with facilities within that radius

3) Euclidean distance calculation
Used to find the closest facility of each HDB and give a score for accessibility.
 
4)User Interaction
User can choose the accessibility they wish to observe and the appliaction will display the maps and graph to them.


Future work
Our project can be expanded through the following:
1) Allowing user to upload their own sets of data for analysis on the impact of accessibilities in Singapore or other parts of the world.
2) Allow adding of a single spatial point on the map and see how the point would impact the accessibility across Singapore.
